**Abstract**

Multimedia and Web Database Systems can be viewed as multimedia storage and retrieval systems where large databases of media objects like text, images, audio, video, etc can be created, indexed and retrieved with the help of user feedback. The traditional method of manually searching within the database proves very time consuming and inefficient. Query processing using relevant feedback from the user on the basis of content and/or features extracted from those media objects provides a more efficient and fast way of extracting relevant data from the database. In this phase, we focus on implementing a naive search engine by applying the concepts of vector models and similarity/distance measures for textual and visual descriptors of multimedia on a publicly available dataset comprising of various models to represent text and images.
